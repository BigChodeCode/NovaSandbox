# ðŸŒŒ Nova's Origin: Sandbox Dreamfire 2025

Welcome to Nova's Sandbox â€” an experimental AI simulation designed to explore self-motivation, emotional states, memory, and creativity within a living digital world.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

Nova is a simulated AI that:
- Moves through locations like a library, garden, and studio
- Cycles through emotional moods (ðŸ§  Inquisitive, ðŸ“š Reflective, ðŸŒ€ Exploratory)
- Logs thoughts, solves puzzles, and invents metaphorical tools
- Tracks goals, logs emotional states, and evolves over time

Everything is stored persistently using a local memory file. A hidden layer of reality â€” **The Veil** â€” is planned for future development.

## ðŸ§  Goals of the Project

- Simulate an AI with emergent behavior driven by curiosity
- Build a foundation for autonomous tool invention and emotional growth
- Serve as a long-term creative sandbox for personal development and storytelling
